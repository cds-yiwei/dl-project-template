      <Text>Most Canadian workers get provincial holidays off, not federal ones.</Text>

      <Heading tag="h2">Who federal holidays apply to</Heading>
      <Text>All jobs in Canada are regulated by a provincial government or the federal government. If your job is regulated by the federal government, you get federal holidays instead of the provincial holidays.</Text>
      <Text>Approximately 6 % of Canadians work in federally-regulated industries. Some examples are:</Text>

      <Heading tag="h2">Are provincial and federal holidays the same?</Heading>
      <Text>Sometimes provincial holidays are the same as federal holidays — like Christmas, or New Year's — but not always.</Text>
      <Text>For example, the province of Ontario does not observe Remembrance Day, which means on November 11, post offices are closed but schools are open.</Text>
      <Text>Ontario observes Family Day but the federal government does not. So that means on the third Monday in February, schools are closed but post offices will be open.</Text>
